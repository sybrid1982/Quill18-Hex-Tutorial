# Quill18-Hex-Tutorial
Playing with hexes

This is code written from Quill18's Mostly Civilized video tutorial series:

I've added a fair bit of functionality that he hasn't gotten to yet,
and I suspect I'll be refactoring in his (better) work as he writes
tutorials.  I'm enjoying trying to build out ahead of him and then see
how he does things differently.

My code is probably terrible, fair warning.
